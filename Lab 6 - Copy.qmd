## The Data

Today we will be using electricity demand data, based on a paper by James W Taylor:

> Taylor, J.W. (2003) Short-term electricity demand forecasting using double seasonal exponential smoothing. Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 799-805.

The data can be found in the `timetk` package as `timetk::taylor_30_min`, a tibble with dimensions: 4,032 x 2

-   `date`: A date-time variable in 30-minute increments

-   `value`: Electricity demand in Megawatts

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: get electricity demand data
data <- timetk::taylor_30_min

dplyr::glimpse(data)

View(data)
```

## Exercise 1: EDA

Plot the data using the functions `timetk::plot_time_series`, `timetk::plot_acf_diagnostics` (using 100 lags), and `timetk::plot_seasonal_diagnostics`.

## YOUR ANSWER Q1:

```{r}
# - plot the data
timetk::taylor_30_min |>
  timetk::plot_time_series(
    date
    , value
    , .title = "Short-term electricity demand (30 min)"
  )

```

```{r}
# - plot the acf, pacf
timetk::taylor_30_min |>
  timetk::plot_acf_diagnostics(
    date
    , value
    , .lags = 100
    , .title = "Lag Diagnostics - Short-term electricity demand (30 min)")

```

```{r}
# - plot the acf, pacf

library(dplyr)

timetk::taylor_30_min %>%
  timetk::plot_seasonal_diagnostics(
    date,
    value,
    .title = "Seasonal Diagnostics - Short-term electricity demand (30mins)"
  )

```

The ACF and PACF diagnostics reveal strong autocorrelation and clear seasonality in the short-term electricity demand data.\

The ACF plot displays a sinusoidal pattern with correlations remaining high across many lags, confirming that electricity demand follows a repeating daily cycle.\

The PACF plot shows a strong spike at lag 1, suggesting that each 30-minute demand value is highly dependent on the immediately preceding value. Overall, the series exhibits strong time dependence and seasonality, which must be considered before applying forecasting models like ARIMA.

## Exercise 2: Time scaling

The raw data has 30 minute intervals between data points. Downscale the data to 60 minute intervals, using `timetk::summarise_by_time`, revising the electricity demand (value) variable by adding the two 30-minute intervals in each 60-minute interval. Assign the downscaled data to the variable `taylor_60_min`.

## YOUR ANSWER Q2:

```{r}

set.seed(1111)
taylor_60_min <- timetk::taylor_30_min %>% 
  timetk::summarise_by_time(
    .date_var = date,
    .by = "hour",
    value = sum(value)
  )
```

## Exercise 3: Training and test datasets

1.  Split the new (60 min) time series into training and test sets using `timetk::time_series_split`
    1.  set the training period ('initial') to '2 months' and the assessment period to '1 weeks'
2.  Prepare the data resample specification with `timetk::tk_time_series_cv_plan()` and plot it with `timetk::plot_time_series_cv_plan`
3.  Separate the training and test data sets using `rsample` .

## YOUR ANSWER Q3:

```{r}
splits <- taylor_60_min %>% 
  timetk::time_series_split(
    initial = "2 months",
    assess = "1 weeks"
  )
```

```{r}
# plot

splits %>% 
  timetk::tk_time_series_cv_plan() %>% 
  timetk::plot_time_series_cv_plan(
    .date_var = date,
    .value = value,
    .title = "Cross Validation Plan for Short Term electicity demand (30 mins)"
  )
```

```{r}
train <- rsample::training(splits)
test <- rsample::testing(splits)
```

## Exercise 4: recipes

1.  Create a base recipe (base_rec) using the formula `value ~ date` and the training data. This will be used for non-regression models

2.  Create a recipe (lm_rec) using the formula `value ~ .` and the `training` data. This will be used for regression models. For this recipe:

    1.  add time series signature features using `timetk::step_timeseries_signature` with the appropriate argument,
    2.  add a step to select the columns `value`, `date_index.num`, `date_month.lbl`, `date_wday.lbl`, `date_hour` ,
    3.  add a normalization step targeting `date_index.num` ,
    4.  add a step to mutate `date_hour`, changing it to a factor,
    5.  add a step to one-hot encode nominal predictors.

## YOUR ANSWER Q4:

```{r}

base_rec <- recipes::recipe(value ~ date, data = train)

lm_rec <- recipes::recipe(value ~ ., data = train) %>%
  timetk::step_timeseries_signature(date) %>% 
  recipes::step_select(value, date_index.num, date_month.lbl, date_wday.lbl, date_hour) %>% 
  recipes::step_normalize(date_index.num) %>% 
  recipes::step_mutate(date_hour = date_hour %>% as.factor()) %>% 
  recipes::step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = TRUE)

```

## Exercise 5 models

Now we will create a several models to estimate electricity demand, as follows

1.  Create a model specification for an exponential smoothing model using engine 'ets'
2.  Create a model specification for an arima model using engine 'auto_arima'
3.  Create a model specification for a linear model using engine 'glmnet' and penalty = 0.02, mixture = 0.5

## YOUR ANSWER Q5:

```{r}
model_ets <- modeltime::exp_smoothing() %>% 
  parsnip::set_engine(engine = "ets")

model_arima <- modeltime::arima_reg() %>% 
  parsnip::set_engine(engine = "auto_arima")

model_lm <- parsnip::linear_reg(penalty = 0.02,mixture = 0.5 ) %>% 
  parsnip::set_engine(engine = "glmnet")
```

## Exercise 6 model fitting

Create a workflow **for each model** using `workflows::workflow`.

1.  Add a recipe to the workflow
    1.  the linear model uses the `lm_rec` recipe created above
    2.  the `ets` and `arima` models use the `base_rec` recipe created above
2.  Add a model to each workflow
3.  Fit with the training data

## YOUR ANSWER Q6:

```{r}


workflow_fit_ets <- workflows::workflow() %>% 
  workflows::add_recipe(base_rec) %>% 
  workflows::add_model(model_ets) %>% 
  parsnip::fit(train)

  workflow_fit_arima <- workflows::workflow() %>% 
  workflows::add_recipe(base_rec) %>% 
  workflows::add_model(model_arima) %>% 
  parsnip::fit(train)

 workflow_fit_lm <- workflows::workflow() %>% 
  workflows::add_recipe(lm_rec) %>% 
  workflows::add_model(model_lm) %>% 
  parsnip::fit(train)
```

## Exercise 7: calibrate

In this exercise we'll use the **testing data** with our fitted models.

1.  Create a table with the fitted workflows using `modeltime::modeltime_table`
2.  Using the table you just created, run a calibration on the **test data** with the function `modeltime::modeltime_calibrate`.
3.  Compare the accuracy of the models using the `modeltime::modeltime_accuracy()` on the results of the calibration.

## YOUR ANSWER Q7:

```{r}

model_tbl <- modeltime::modeltime_table(
      workflow_fit_ets,
      workflow_fit_arima,
      workflow_fit_lm
)

calibration_tbl <- model_tbl %>% 
  modeltime::modeltime_calibrate(test)

calibration_tbl  %>%  modeltime::modeltime_accuracy()
```

::: callout-important
Which is the best model by the (smallest) **rmse** metric? GLMNET is 3022.407
:::

## Exercise 8: forecast - training data

Use the calibration table with `modeltime::modeltime_forecast` to graphically compare the fits to the training data with the observed values.

## YOUR ANSWER Q8:

```{r}
calibration_tbl %>%  
  modeltime::modeltime_forecast(
    new_data = test,
    actual_data = taylor_60_min
  ) %>%  modeltime::plot_modeltime_forecast()
        
```

## Exercise 9: forecast - future

Now refit the models using the **full data set** (using the calibration table and `modeltime::modeltime_refit`). Save the result in the variable **refit_tbl**.

1.  Use the refit data in the variable **refit_tbl**, along with `modeltime::modeltime_forecast` and argument `h` = '2 weeks' (remember to also set the `actual_data` argument). This will use the models to forecast electricity demand two weeks into the future.
2.  Plot the forecast with `modeltime::plot_modeltime_forecast`

## YOUR ANSWER Q9:

```{r}
refit_tbl <- calibration_tbl %>% 
  modeltime::modeltime_refit(data = taylor_60_min)

refit_tbl %>% 
  modeltime::modeltime_forecast(h = '2 weeks', actual_data = taylor_60_min) %>% 
  modeltime::plot_modeltime_forecast(
    .legend_max_width = 12,
    .interactive = TRUE
  )
```

## Exercise 10: Seasonal Time Series Modeling for Retail Forecasting

You are working as a Senior Business Analyst for "TechMart," a consumer electronics retailer with 50 stores across North America. The company is planning its inventory strategy for 2025 and needs accurate forecasts of monthly sales. The CFO has specifically requested that you use advanced decomposition methods that can handle the complex seasonal patterns in electronics retail.

You have been provided with 60 months of historical sales data (Jan 2019 - Dec 2023) showing strong monthly seasonality (holiday shopping peaks) and an underlying growth trend due to market expansion.

```{r}
#
# retail data
retail_dat <- readr::read_csv("C:/Users/abedi/Downloads/TechMart_sales.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)

# Display data summary
cat("TechMart Monthly Sales Data Summary:\n")
```

```{r}
cat("====================================\n")
```

```{r}
cat("Period:", format(min(retail_dat$date), "%b %Y"), "to", 
    format(max(retail_dat$date), "%b %Y"), "\n")
```

```{r}
cat("Observations:", nrow(retail_dat), "\n")
```

```{r}
print(summary(retail_dat$monthly_sales))
```

Using the `modeltime` and `parsnip` frameworks,

1.  build and compare ETS(A,A,A) and ETS(M,MD,M) models. Use log(sales) as the outcome. Use `workflows` and `modeltime::exp_smoothing`, setting the error, trend, season, and damped argument explicitly for each model (see the help for `modeltime::exp_smoothing` ). For ETS(M,M,M), set damping = "damped" (NOTE: the default is 'damped').

2.  forecast sales one month ahead, and extract the forecast for January 2024. Plot the forecasts.

## YOUR ANSWER Q10:

```{r}
#recipe
base_rec <- 
  retail_dat %>% 
  recipes::recipe(monthly_sales ~ date) %>% 
  recipes::step_log(monthly_sales)

#model
model_ets_AAA <-
  modeltime::exp_smoothing(error = "additive", trend = "additive", season = "additive", damping = "none") %>% 
  parsnip::set_engine(engine= "ets")
                             
model_ets_MMM <-
  modeltime::exp_smoothing(error = "multiplicative", trend = "multiplicative", season = "multiplicative", damping = "damped") %>% 
  parsnip::set_engine(engine= "ets")                             
 
#workflow
workflow_fit_AAA <- workflows::workflow() %>% 
  workflows::add_recipe(base_rec) %>% 
  workflows::add_model(model_ets_AAA) %>% 
parsnip::fit(retail_dat)

workflow_fit_MMM <- workflows::workflow() %>% 
  workflows::add_recipe(base_rec) %>% 
  workflows::add_model(model_ets_MMM) %>% 
parsnip::fit(retail_dat)

#Make Table
model_tbl <- modeltime::modeltime_table(
  workflow_fit_AAA, workflow_fit_MMM
)


#calibration
calibration_tbl <- model_tbl %>% 
  modeltime::modeltime_calibrate(retail_dat)

#predictiction directly as no test data or cross validation used
prediction <- calibration_tbl %>% 
  modeltime::modeltime_forecast(h = "1 month", actual_data = retail_dat)

#plot graph
prediction %>% 
  dplyr::slice_tail(n=2) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = .model_desc, y = .value)) +
    geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = .conf_lo, ymax = .conf_hi), width = 0.2, color = "blue") +
    labs(
      title = "HAHAHA Predictions with Error Bars",
      x = "Model",
      y = "Sales ($millions)"
    ) + theme_minimal()

```
